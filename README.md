### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Welcome to my github

The Global Cassava Program is a research program led by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) that aims to improve the productivity, profitability, and sustainability of cassava production and use in developing countries. Cassava is a major staple food and source of income for millions of smallholder farmers, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The program is focused on finding ways to increase its production and improve the livelihoods of these farmers.
