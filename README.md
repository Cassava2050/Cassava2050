# Cassava Program

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for the Cassava program developed by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). The goal of the program is to improve the productivity, profitability, and sustainability of cassava production and use in developing countries. Cassava is a major staple food and source of income for millions of smallholder farmers, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. The program is focused on finding ways to increase its production and improve the livelihoods of these farmers.
